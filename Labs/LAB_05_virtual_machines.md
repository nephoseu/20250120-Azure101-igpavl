# Lab 05 - Virtual Machines

## Challenge scenario

You will learn fundamentals of Virtual Machines - How to create, select the right size and how to manage them. 

The solutions will not be provided - you should have enough experience by now to explore Azure Portal on your own. In case you do have trouble, there are some hints available, but you can also ask your facilitator for help.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:

+ Create a new virtual machine
+ Explore different sitzes of Virtual machines


## Challenges

### Challenge 1 - your first VM

1. Create a new Virtual Machine with the following settings

    |Name|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Resource Group| rgProduction |
    |Name| vmmyfirstVM |
    |Image| Unitnut Server 24.04 LTS |
    |Size| B1ls |
    |Auth type| Password |
    |Username| linuxuser |
    |Password| Pa$$W0rd1234 |
    |OSDisk| Standard SSD, locally redundand |

    Available sizes depend on numerous number of parameters. To be able to select B1Is size, you need to select Availability option to "No infrastructure redundancy required" and Security set to "Standard"

    All other settings leave default for now. We will configure networking later

1. Get the public IP assigned to your VM
2. Connect to your VM via cloudshell (ssh linuxuser@PUBLIC IP ADDRESS ) and ping 8.8.8.8. (ctrl+c to stop)
3. Type Exit to disconnect
